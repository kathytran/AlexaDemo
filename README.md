- This program allows elders to use the Echo Dot as an efficient way to plan and schedule appointments with relatives (Echo Dot is hands-free and voice-controlled). 

- The elders' schedules are synced with their family members by using Google Calendar. This allows them to find out who is available on a specific day or what days a specific person is available. 

- Then, the users could command Alexa to text whomever is available whether he/she would like to hang out.
